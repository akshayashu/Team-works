# TeamWorks Internship Assignment

I've considered all the mentioned points. According to the sample app, there was no option for hamburger menu in that, therefore with due permission, I've skipped that part but I've created a button for sign out/Logout.
User information(NAME, EMAIL, PASSWORD) is also saved in our database and can be accessed easily. Rest everything is in the app. I hope you like my work and give me your valuable response.

Thank you

Regards
